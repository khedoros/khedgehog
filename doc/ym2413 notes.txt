Envelope: 48db range, 0 is max, -48 is lowest
Key hit: DP=decay of previous note? 10ms to drop from 0 to 48
AR: Attack Rate (rate from 48 to 0)
DR: Decay from attack to SL (sustain level) (doesn't decay for sustained sounds)
RR: Decay after release. 310ms from 0 to 48
RS: Sustain after release. 1.2s from 0 to 48

MULTI: Multiple to apply to wave's f-number. The 16 possible multipliers:
1/2, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 10, 12, 12, 15, 15

KSR: Key Scale of RATE. Something about changing the ADSR based on octave.
I think it means that ADSR rates go faster at higher half-octaves.
If RATE=4*R+Rks, R is the set ADSR value, Rks is the key-scale offset value, when R=0, rate=0

VIB: Applies a 6.4Hz vibrato to the slot, when input is about 3.6MHz
AM: Applies a 3.7Hz amplitude modulation to the slot, when input is about 3.6MHz

Total level: Attenuation of audio. 64 levels in 0.75dB steps.
KSL: Key Scale of Level. Volume's equivalent of KSR. 16 levels in 1.5dB/OCT steps.

DM/DC: Wave is rectified to half-wave

Exponential table:

 x = 0..255, y = round((power(2, x/256)-1)*1024)

When such a table is used for calculation of the exponential, the table is read at the position given by the 8 LSB's of the input. The value + 1024 (the hidden bit) is then the significand of the floating point output and the yet unused MSB's of the input are the exponent of the floating point output. Indeed, YM3812 sends the audio to the YM3014B DAC in floating point, so it is quite possible that summing of voices is done in floating point also.

Log-sin table:

 x = 0..255, y = round(-log(sin((x+0.5)*pi/256/2))/log(2)*256)

This is the first (rising) quarter of sine wave. The rest can be constructed by flipping all the bits of x and/or by changing the sign of the samples.
