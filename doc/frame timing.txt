The values are the HClock (-47 -> 294) divided by 2 or the MClock (0 -> 683)-94 divided by 4.

 The VDP can generate an interrupt relating to two conditions; when the
 vertical blanking period has started (frame interrupt), and when the line
 interrupt counter has expired (line interrupt).

 Frame interrupts

 Depending on the height of the display, the VDP will attempt to generate a
 frame interrupt on the following lines:

 Height  Line
 ------  ----
 192     $C1
 224     $E1
 240     $F1

 The VDP can generate an interrupt relating to two conditions; when the
 vertical blanking period has started (frame interrupt), and when the line
 interrupt counter has expired (line interrupt).

 Frame interrupts

 Depending on the height of the display, the VDP will attempt to generate a
 frame interrupt on the following lines:

 Height  Line
 ------  ----
 192     $C1
 224     $E1
 240     $F1
 
  Line interrupts

 The VDP has a counter that is loaded with the contents of register $0A on
 every line outside of the active display period excluding the line after
 the last line of the active display period. It is decremented on every
 line within the active display period including the line after the last
 line of the active display period.

 I'll admit that's a bad description, though I couldn't think of any other
 way to say it. To help you understand how this works, here is an example
 for a 192-line display on an NTSC machine that has 262 scanlines per frame:

 Out of lines 0-261:
 - The counter is decremented on lines 0-191 and 192.
 - The counter is reloaded on lines 193-261.

 When the counter underflows from $00 to $FF, it is reloaded with the last
 value written to register $0A. Writing to register $0A will not immediately
 change the contents of the counter, this only occurs when the counter is
 reloaded (meaning outside of the active display period as described above,
 or when the counter has underflows).

 When the counter underflows, the VDP sets an internal flag which I will
 call the line interrupt pending flag. This flag remains set until the
 control port is read.

 Bit 4 of register $00 acts like a on/off switch for the VDP's IRQ line.
 As long as the line interrupt pending flag is set, the VDP will assert the
 IRQ line if bit 4 of register $00 is set, and it will de-assert the IRQ line
 if the same bit is cleared.

VINT occur at HClock -18 (HCount 0xF3), -14 (Hcount 0xF6) on MD.
HINT occur at HClock -17 (HCount 0xF3), -13 (Hcount 0xF6) on MD.
NMI occur at HClock -16 (HCount 0xF4).
VCount change at HClock -16 (HCount 0xF4), -13 (HCount 0xF6) on MD.
VINT flag is set at HClock -15 (HCount 0xF5). -13 (HCount 0xF6) on MD.
OVR flag is set at HClock -15 (HCount 0xF5). -13 (HCount 0xF6) on MD.
COL flag is set at the pixel it occurs. -13 (HCount 0xFF) on MD.
XScroll is latched between HClock -18 & -17 (HCount 0xF3), HClock -15 & -14 (HCount 0xF5 & 0xF6) on MD.
YScroll is latched between HClock ? & ? (HCount ?) on line ?
    HClock ? & ? (HCount ? & ?) on MD.

NameTable base is not latched, it's updated through out the scanline.
