port 00 (RO):
bit 7: start button. 0=pressed, 1=open
bit 6: region. 0=domestic (JP), 1=overseas
bit 5: pal/ntsc. 0=ntsc, 1=pal.

port 01(RW):
bits 0-6: Read/write when EXT used as 7-bit IO port. These are called the "PC" registers.

port 02(RW):
bit 7: 0=NMI generated when PC6 is input and falls, 1=no NMI
Bit 0-6: 0=output, 1=input. Configures port $01 directions.

port 03(RW):
bit 0-7: used to send data during serial communications.

port 04(RO):
bit 0-7: used to receive data during serial communications.

port 05(RW):
bit 6-7: RW. baud rating. 00 = 4800bps, 01=2400bps, 10=1200bps, 11=300bps
bit 5: RW. 0=receive disable. 1=receive enable (PC5 is made an input)
bit 4: RW. 0=send disable. 1=send enable (PC4 is made an output) 
bit 3: RW. 0=no nmi when data is received. 1=nmi when data is received (makes port 2 bit 7 redundant)
bit 2: RO. 0=no framing error. 1=framing error detected.
bit 1: RO. 0=no received data in buffer. 1=received data in buffer.
bit 0: RO. 0=send buffer is empty/ready. 1=send buffer is full.

7: audio chan 3 left enable
6: audio chan 2 left enable
5: audio chan 1 left enable
4: audio chan 0 left enabled
3: audio chan 3 right enable
2: audio chan 2 right enable
1: audio chan 1 right enable
0: audio chan 0 right enabled

port 30(RO):
development board loader access

port 31(RO):
printer status, bottom 3 bits
